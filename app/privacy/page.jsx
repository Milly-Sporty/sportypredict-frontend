            <strong>Website:</strong> may collect personal data (email, name,

        <p>
          When you interact with the Website, we may collect the following
          categories of personal information:
        </p>

        <h3>Account and contact information</h3>
        <ul className={styles.bulletList}>
          <li>
            Name, email address, username, profile data, and any other
            information you provide when registering or contacting support.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Billing and subscription data</h3>
        <ul className={styles.bulletList}>
          <li>
            Billing name and email address, tokenized payment reference (if you
            pay via our web checkout), subscription status and transaction
            metadata. (If you purchase via the App, the store processes payment
            and we only receive transaction metadata and subscription
            confirmation.)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Communications</h3>
        <ul className={styles.bulletList}>
          <li>
            Support requests, feedback, and other communications you send to us.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical & usage data</h3>
        <ul className={styles.bulletList}>
          <li>

            timestamps, session identifiers, referrer, and usage analytics.

        <h2>3. Data collected by the App (important)</h2>
        <ul className={styles.bulletList}>
          <li>
            The SportyPredict mobile App currently does not collect, store, or
            transmit personal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            The App does not require registration or collect contact details by
            default.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you make an in-app purchase (Premium/VIP), payment processing is
            handled by the App Store / Play Store; we do not receive payment
            card details from the store. We may receive transaction confirmation
            and subscription identifiers (Transaction ID) from the store so we
            can enable access to Premium features.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If this behavior changes in future app releases (for example, if
          account creation is added), we will update this Privacy Policy and
          notify users where required.
